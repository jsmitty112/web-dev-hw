It was interesting to see the style and how it worked out. I had a few issues in linking but i believed they are solved. It was new learning the structure and how to code this. It was a challenge on how to structure this correctly. I am anxious about CSS because it seems more difficult to work with.
I used similar styling in previous assignments for this one. It was hard for me to see how this layout will look. Its difficult to remember everything from last assignment and i find myself going back to see what to do.
