# README
My deign process started with harry potter in the back of my head so i wanted to try and have the font revolve around the magical world he live in. I chose Arial be cause its appealing and caveat for something new.
System fonts are fonts installed on the system, allowing them to be pulled up whenever. They are already with the system and dont have to be downloaded.
Web Fonts are fonts hosted on a specific web server. They are made for specific use on the web server only. They can be downloaded to view the web server better.
Web Safe Fonts are the best for fallback fonts and they allow better compatibility with fonts and the web server to be used.
I was challened by making this site the way i wanted to. It was a challenge to see where fonts will go and to expect how big they will look. I found myself going back and fourth to make adjusments to placment and color overall.
