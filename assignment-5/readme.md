I chose the graphic that looked like a flowing river. Color was a big part of the 70s. I chose a color that stands out for the background. It was a mix of colors. The colors reflect the vibrant colors the 70s had and the diversity in colors that were seen in the 70s.

The  three colors i used were 2 similar colors of different shades and on bright color. Complimented the graphic well. 006699, 4dffff, and #ffff00 were the colors.

I had troubles getting the right placement of the graphic along with the txt. I would modify something then try to see if it worked but then nothing would change so it was a challenge to get the txt in place i wanted it as with the graphic. I feel i was making it harder then it was.
