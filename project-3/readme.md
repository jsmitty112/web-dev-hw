Borders are real borders put around an element. Margins is the spacing between an element and its surrounding areas. Paddling is in an element and used inside its border.
My challenge this assignment was layout creation and placement. I feel its hard to get a sense of what it will look like until you go back and fourth checking. Finding the correct layout code was challenging as well.
I tried to first figure out a design scheme with the right colors. Then from there i just had to go back and fourth with seeing how the layout was coded and how it was displayed. I had issues with the css part but i seemed to be ok with the end result in the end.
